# RubyAssitant
Word and Joke of the day files


NOTE: THIS IS ONLY SOME OF THE CODE THAT I WROTE


Our project was to create the "Ruby Assistant", which runs in
the console and allows you to fetch useful information from the
web. The features include catching up on Tweets, the weather,  the
news, your personal google calendar events, and the word, quote, fact,
and joke of the day.
Usage:
$ ruby AssistantStarter.rb
Note there are some dependencies.

Gems: Use the installGems.sh script to set up the gems used in the project.
Authentication:

The Twitter Feature requires developer API keys (set up in an .env
file in the root directory)
The Gooogle Calendar feature needs Google authentication. Copy and
paste the link given the first time the feature is requested, grant
access, and then your browser will give you a link to paste back to
the application. Then select the feature again to see your upcoming
Google Calendar events.
